# Setup (first start)

The release packages contain no game files and no game code. The first start of **Wind Waker HD**
builds the game on the player's machine from their own dump (a disc image, a Cemu archive or an
extracted game folder): it extracts the game (a disc image or archive only), translates its code to C, compiles it with a pinned compiler
and links it with the prebuilt runtime. Later starts launch the built game directly. Player
instructions are in the main README ("Download for Steam Deck").

This project's Actions produce a Steam Deck Linux x86-64 package only. The common installer
retains inherited platform helpers for maintainability; they are not additional release targets.
Deck manifests include initial `settings.ini` values for interpolated 60 FPS, 1x, FIFO and PiP.
They are written only when no settings file exists; updates/repair preserve user choices.

## Portable releases

A release folder contains `portable.txt`. Then everything stays in `<release>/data`:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `data/bin/wwhd` (`.exe`) | the built game; `data/bin/portable.txt` puts the runtime in portable mode |
| `data/game/` | game files extracted from a disc image or Cemu archive (an extracted folder chosen by the player is used where it is) |
| `data/save/` | saves |
| `data/user/` | settings, controls, graphics options, save states, shader caches (`host::portable_user_dir()`) |
| `data/captures/` | crash logs (the game runs in `data/`) |
| `data/install.json`, `data/setup.log` | what was prepared (paths inside `data/` relative, so the folder can move), and the setup log |
| `data/toolchain/`, `data/python/` | the downloaded compiler (Windows, Linux; removable at the end) and Python (Windows, or Linux without Python 3) |

Runtime side: a `portable.txt` next to the game executable makes `host::config_dir()` return
`<folder>/user` (`runtime/src/platform/host.h`); `main.cpp` points the macOS-only paths (save states,
display settings, Metal shader cache) there through their existing overrides; `gfx/menu.mm` keeps the
graphics options in `user/graphics.plist` instead of NSUserDefaults; the Controls window does not
autosave its frame. Without the marker (source builds) nothing changes. Shortcuts (Applications link,
Start menu, applications menu) are only created when the player asks for one.

## Pieces

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `setup.py` | all of the installation logic (Python 3.8+, standard library only) |
| `toolchains.json` | pinned compilers and Python downloads (URL + SHA-256); CI builds with the same ones |
| `gui/setup_gui.cpp` | **Wind Waker HD**, the program a release starts: first-start setup, then the game launcher (SDL3 + Dear ImGui) |
| `install-macos.command` | setup in Terminal, macOS (shipped as `tools/Setup in Terminal.command`) |
| `install-windows.bat` + `bootstrap-windows.ps1` | setup in a console window, Windows (`tools/Setup in a console window.bat`; fetches the pinned embeddable Python) |
| `install-linux.sh` | setup in a terminal, Linux (`tools/setup-in-terminal.sh`; falls back to a pinned standalone Python) |
| `test_setup.py` | unit tests of the helpers (`python3 tools/installer/test_setup.py`) |

In a release folder the program is `Wind Waker HD.app` (macOS), `Wind Waker HD.exe` (Windows) or
`wind-waker-hd` plus `Wind Waker HD.desktop` (Linux); the terminal setup in `tools/` is the fallback.

## Wind Waker HD (the program a release starts)

On start, when `data/install.json` says the game is prepared for this release (same version as
`sdk/manifest.json`, the executable and the game files are there), it starts the game right away and
shows no window of its own (macOS, Linux: `exec`, so the Dock keeps "Wind Waker HD"; Windows: starts
the game without a console window and exits). Otherwise, or with Shift held at start (macOS,
Windows) or `--setup`, it shows the setup.

The setup is only a front end: it runs the release's terminal setup with `--gui-protocol` as a child
process (so Python is found or fetched exactly as in the terminal setup) and talks to `setup.py`
over its stdin/stdout. Screens: welcome (or, when installed: play / update / repair / reinstall /
import saves or settings / open the folder), choose the disc image, Cemu archive or game folder (native file dialogs), keys
(disc images only: disc key found next to the image or chosen; common key as a file or pasted into a hidden field), installation
(a bar per step, an overall bar, the log under "Details"), optional save import (an HD `cking.sav`
folder, a GameCube `.gci` converted with `tools/savegame/gc2hd.py`, or the saves and settings of an
earlier installation or another release folder, copied), done (Play, Open folder, Quit; in a portable
release also: remove the downloaded compiler, add a shortcut), and error screens with Retry and Copy
log. On macOS it first checks for Apple's Command
Line Tools and offers Apple's installer, as the Terminal launcher does.

Build: `-DWWHD_SETUP_GUI=ON` adds the `wwhd-setup` target (`cmake/SetupGui.cmake`). SDL3 is linked
statically on macOS and Windows (pinned source, release toolchain); Linux uses the shared SDL3 the
release ships in `sdk/runtime`. The ImGui SDL3 and SDL_Renderer backends are the unmodified ones of
the vendored ImGui release.

## Linux on x86-64 and arm64

Upstream supports `linux-x86_64` and `linux-aarch64`; this project's workflow packages x86-64 only.
The inherited format records its toolchain in `sdk/manifest.json`: `zig-0.16.0`
(x86-64 host, target `x86_64-linux-gnu.2.35`) or `zig-0.16.0-aarch64` (arm64 host, target
`aarch64-linux-gnu.2.35`), both pinned with their SHA-256 in `toolchains.json`, so the game code a
player compiles always matches the prebuilt runtime. `setup.py` refuses a release for the other
architecture (`uname -m`), and the terminal setup fetches the matching standalone Python
(`python.linux` or `python.linux-aarch64`) when the system has no Python 3.8+.

On Linux arm64 the runtime reserves the guest's 4 GB at 64 GiB instead of 32 TiB (`PPC_MEM_BASE`,
as on Android): many arm64 kernels (Raspberry Pi OS and other 4K-page configurations) give processes
only a 39-bit (512 GiB) address space. Plain `char` is built signed there (`-fsigned-char`, also
for the player-compiled game code), as on x86-64 and Apple arm64.

Options: arguments it does not know are passed to `setup.py` (`--data-dir DIR`, `--app-dir DIR`,
`--jobs N`). For tests: `--self-test` (start setup.py, wait for its hello, render the first screen,
exit 0), `--automate SCRIPT.json` (scripted clicks, see the comment in `setup_gui.cpp`) and
`--screenshots DIR`. With `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=offscreen` nothing is shown on screen (software
rendering), which is how CI and local tests run it.

## `setup.py --gui-protocol`

One JSON object per line. Events on stdout all have `"event"`:

| event | fields |
|---|---|
| `hello` | `version`, `platform`, `data_dir`, `app_dir`, `log`, `portable`, `package`, `installed` (state or null), `game_files`, `game_dir`, `save_exists`, `legacy` (an earlier installation to copy from), `free_bytes`, `toolchain` |
| `log` | `text` (also written to `setup.log`) |
| `plan` | `steps`: `[{id, title}]` of the installation that starts |
| `step` | `n`, `total`, `title`, `id` (`keys`, `archive`, `folder`, `compiler`, `extract`, `copy`, `translate`, `compile`, `app`) |
| `progress` | `label`, `done`, `total`, `detail` |
| `reply` | `id` and `cmd` of the request, `ok`; on failure `problem` and `message` |
| `fatal` | `message` (setup cannot run, e.g. the wrong release for this system) |

Requests on stdin: `{"cmd": ..., "id": n, ...}`

| cmd | fields | reply |
|---|---|---|
| `probe` | `path` | `kind` (`image`/`archive`/`folder`), `disc_key` (found next to the image), `common_key` (where one was found); for a folder `in_place`, `bytes`; for an archive `title`, `folder`, `bytes`, `message` (which title is used and why); problem `wrong_title` when the archive has no usable game |
| `check_keys` | `image`, optional `disc_key_file`, `common_key_file` or `common_key_hex` | `title_id`, `files`, `bytes`; problems `disc_key_wrong`, `common_key_wrong`, `wrong_title`, ... |
| `install` | `source` (`image`/`archive`/`folder`/`installed`), `path`, optional `jobs` | streams `plan`/`step`/`progress`/`log`, then `app`, `exe`, `data_dir`, `game_dir`, `toolchain_bytes` |
| `import_save` | `kind` (`hd`/`gc`), `path`, optional `replace` | `message`; problem `exists` when a save is installed and `replace` is not set (with `replace`, the old save is moved to `save/user.backup-<time>` first) |
| `import_existing` | optional `path` (another release folder; none: the earlier per-user installation), `replace` | `message` (saves and settings copied, never moved; problem `exists` as above) |
| `remove_toolchain` | | `freed` bytes |
| `shortcut` | | `path` of the created shortcut |
| `launch` | | starts the installed game |
| `quit` | | |

Keys: an image install uses the keys from the last successful `check_keys`; they stay in the
`setup.py` process's memory and are dropped when the installation starts extracting. Requests are
never logged or echoed, and no key is written to disk or passed on a command line.

## Cemu archives (`.wua`)

A `.wua` is Cemu's Wii U archive: a [ZArchive](https://github.com/Exzap/ZArchive) file (zstd-compressed
64 KiB blocks, SHA-256 of the whole file in its footer) with already decrypted titles, one folder per
title named `<title id>_v<version>`, often the game, its update and DLC together. No keys are needed:
the GUI skips the key screen and the terminal setup asks for none.

`wwhd-extract --title 0005000010143500 info GAME.wua` lists every title folder and the one selected;
setup then decides (`archive_choice` in `setup.py`) and logs which title it uses and why:

- the game itself, `0005000010143500_v0`, is used: the port's translated code and its hooks are made
  for version 0 of the USA game (the disc and eShop release);
- an update (`0005000e10143500_v..`) is not used, neither its code (another version) nor its data
  files (they belong to the update's code); DLC or other titles are listed as not used;
- another region, an archive with only the update, another game, or a version other than 0 stop
  with an explanation.

`wwhd-extract --title FOLDER --progress extract GAME.wua data/game.partial` first checks the archive's
SHA-256 ("phase verify", the step's bar shows "checking the archive"), then writes the title folder's
`code`, `content` and `meta` ("phase extract"); damaged archives (exit 8), truncated or foreign files
(exit 7) and a missing title (exit 10) are reported before anything is written. The space check is
the selected title's size plus 1 GB, as for a disc image. Tests: `extract_wua` (ctest, a synthetic
archive written by the test) and `ArchiveTitles` in `test_setup.py`.

## Game version check

The translated code and its hooks (`tools/recomp/hooks*.txt`) are made for one file: `code/cking.rpx`
of The Wind Waker HD (USA), title 00050000-10143500, version 0. `setup.py` keeps its SHA-256
(`SUPPORTED_RPX_SHA256`, a checksum only: it identifies the file and contains nothing of it;
`guard.py` flags 32-digit, key-shaped strings, not 64-digit sums) and `check_game_version` compares
it for every source before anything is translated: an extracted folder at the "folder" step (and
already when the window probes it), a disc image or Cemu archive right after extracting (into
`game.partial`, which is then removed, so an earlier `game/` stays), a repair or update with the
installed files. On a mismatch the message says what was found (another title, "an update merged in"
when `code/app.xml` or `meta/meta.xml` give a version above 0 or the update's title id, otherwise
"not the expected file" with the start of its SHA-256), what is needed and how to get it. Tests:
`GameVersion` in `test_setup.py` (synthetic files; `WWHD_GAME_DIR=game` also checks your own copy).
The recompiler reads only `code/cking.rpx` (the runtime checks at start that it matches the translated
code); the other files in `code/` (`app.xml`, `cos.xml`) are metadata and are not checked.
